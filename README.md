`Paper`: One ruler to measure them all: Benchmarking multilingual long-context language models 

`Authors`: Yekyung Kim, Jenna Russell, Marzena Karpinska, Mohit Iyyer

ONERULER is a multilingual benchmark designed to evaluate long-context language models across 26 languages. ONERULER adapts the English-only [RULER](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06654) benchmark by including seven synthetic tasks that test both retrieval and aggregation, including new variations of the ‚Äúneedle-in-a-haystack‚Äù task that allow for the possibility of a nonexistent needle. We translate English instructions for each task and then collaborating with native speakers to translate them into 25 additional languages.  

This code is based on /[Repo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/RULER).
